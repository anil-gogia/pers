Anil Gogia special skills :-
============================


Anil Gogia has developed a UHG proprietary Framework, UPM3 to compare configuration documents with database of multiple environments and this Framework is required on most of the healthcare applications and hence Anil Gogia is the most suitable for this position. Anil Gogia has developed United Programming Model 3 (UPM3) framework which he build after his experience with Business services of United Programming Model. He build new UPM 3 framework using Modular OSGI Runtime Container (MORC) and developed underlying MINDI Framework. Since United Programming integrate various business groups of United ranging from Member Enrollment, Comparison of various treatment across various Providers with in a particular location,
Pharmacy, Benefits, Fraud detection.

Anil Gogia has developed Configuration Validation tool,Web Service Framework, Test Data Management tool for UHG proprietary applications as part of UPM3 Framework, so he knows all the technical aspects of automation and the business needs and thus has already proven his skills in this area. He is most experience person in the team having expertise in configuration validation with multiple databases for different UHG proprietary applications. Since this project required a great understanding of UHG proprietary applications (Healthcare applications) and this Framework need to be customized for each and every health care applications, a person having comprehensive experience in both areas is required. There is nobody else in the team having the same experience on Configuration Validation tool as Anil Gogia. 


Issues with current UPM 2 Framework :-
Currently all AE business services are designed according to UPM2 Framework. Where all 800 plus AE Business services are packeged into a single unit - Enterprise Archive file (EAR). 
With moving to UPM3 framework, Organization can achieve reduce overall cost and time and will increase quality and robustness of AE bisiness services.

Following are issues with the curent framework and UPM3 Framework is answer to all issues what Business Segment faces.
1. Frequest application down time :-
Whenever there is need of change of any single Business service, then we have to shut down this packaged unit (EAR) file, which results into shud down of all 800 plus services.
Since Application Enablement acts as Connecting system of the United Organization which deals with all business units, and has more than 800 plus business services, 
so almost every week we have to do two production deployment so that we cann includes all changes comes from variosu Business segements becuase of change of their Business needs.
This results in downtime of every business segment whenever we make any change as all services get down during production release of package units - Enterprise Archive (EAR) file.

Downtime results into :- 
a) Loss of Business availability and Trust during downtime.
b) Leads to increase Cost, Time and Effort and leads low quality :- With every production deployment results in Cost of engaging Infrastructure Team, Release Management Team, 
Development Team, Change Management team and Production support team for checkout and verifying services after post deployment. 
We need to engage all teams for verifying all their Business services health irrespective of whether they requested for the change of Businwss services or not as all services are packed into a single units.

2. Securing each servics individualy :-
Securing data is critical and Healthcare Provider have to abide laws to secure Personal Health Information. Its importanty for all Healthcare Provider to not only insure health of their Customer but also make sure their customer data should be accessible to them only so that no misuse and strictly restrict unauthorize data access.
Since Data can be is the most important part of any business group, which should be allowed to access to only authorized person or group of persons of a business segment, UPM3 is providing an extra secure layer for all underlying access with in build framework along with hightly technical tools and standards provided by IT Leaders like IBM datapower.
With UPM 2 we have generic way of securing AE business services and which lacked securing each services individualy for each business segments. With the HIPPA law it is required to secure each AE business service.
New framework UPM 3 make each AE service to be access through WS-Security framework, which will be allowed through UHG policy and through Datapower. To secure a particular service for a particular person or group of persons of a business, UPM3 service embed varios businness rukles which determines whether it is allowed for all underlying services under AE business service or a particular workflow services.

3. Configurable business rules :- changing services on fly without need
4. Integration to various business segments :- ranging from various health care domain orrespective of underlying technologies.
5. UPM 3 can run multiple versions of individual business services
6. Client applications can use the version of the business service they need :- No forced upgrade to newer version when the service itself has not changed.
7. Bug fixes can be deployed independently - Since each bundle is deployed separately, there is no need to force bug fixes to all go together as a package, alleviating sign-off problems.
8. New releases can happen any time. Services are no longer tied to a quarterly release, so off-release service development can be more easily accommodated

Anil Gogia also is the senior most person having experience and skills required for this work. Anil Gogia was the one who initiated development of automation framework solution on Web Service automation and automation solution for Test Data Management to cater to UHG application needs. Other people in the team do not have enough knowledge and hands on experience on the tools developed by Anil Gogia. Moreover, during his tenure of 96 months, Anil Gogia has acquired comprehensive knowledge of the UHG business and proprietary applications to support this automation framework. As is evident from the team information below, Anil Gogia is considerably more experienced on the specific framework that need to be implemented on this assignment in UHG than others in the team. 


Anil Gogia Main responsibility is :- 
====================================
1. Analyzing the new business requirement from the healthcare industry (20%) because of :-
 a) Business Expansion because of market needs and business dymanics and companies mrgers and acquisition vision.

Anil Gogia Specialized skills :-
================================

Comprehensive experience is required on UHG business, different UHG proprietary application automation, configuration models and interaction and integration with clients owning health care application with multiple configurations to carry out this assessment. Apart from Business rule Engine Automation, Configuration Validation tool, Test data management strategy as part of UPM3 Framework, Anil Gogia has experience in each Consumer Buisness process and domain process knowledge as well. No one in team has the same level of experience as Anil Gogia who has skills in different consumer and provider automation area. Anil Gogia is the only person suitable to perform this assessment. 

 
 
Anil Gogia did his Graduation (of five and half years) in Medicine and he is Academy of Healthcare Managment certified from US which shows his expertize command over HealthCare Systems. He is associated with United HealthGroup Systems for 8 years and worked with various applications.
His Medical healthcare knowledge helps him to understand of Patients/Members and Providers needs and his Technical knowledge helps in implementing the system needs to Automation by developing Software.
These skills makes him unique and critical for AE department as he is the only single person who knows Medical HealthCare Business and responsible for designing, architecting and implementation of new UPM 3 Framework which can lead to easy usability and will make UPM3 services more efficient. 

There are no others at his level with the same skill set.  This is the proprietary tool designed, architected and developed by Anil Gogia so he is the only person with adequate knowledge/skill for this position. He is the only person developed UHG proprietary tool for healthcare application configuration validation as well as he is having expertise in framework architecture and web service automation solutions.  In addition to being the developer for the UHG proprietary health care application’s Configuration Validation tool, he was also the developer for Web Service automation framework and solution for Test Data Management. All these solutions need to be integrated as part of this project. Since only Anil Gogia has comprehensive knowledge of all componenets of UPM3 UHG proprietary framework, he is the best person for this position

Because He is the only person who developed UHG proprietary UPM3 Framework, Automation Configuration Validation tool under guidance of Jeff Melby the chief enterprise architect. Anil Gogia will be doing hands on implementation with our Chief Architect Jeff Melby. 

This UPM3 Framework has enabled UHG to validate the configuration of business rules pertaining to the plan and products being applied in different UHG systems much faster than the earlier methods (about 1000 configuration validations are compared in 1 hr. as compared to about 20 validated in 1hr manually). Thus UPM3 Framework can provide significant efficiency and cost savings once implemented on other UHG health care systems hence keeping UHG more competitive in the market in terms of cost.


For the last 8 years he is working with Application Enablement Project where he is very well versed with United HealthCare Business applications and 
The mix of these Functional and Technicakl skills help him to understand need very well as compared to any existing team either at onshore or offshore.


It is taken Anil Gogia about an year to develop this UPM3 Framework during this time he has also learnt from his experience of implementing this UPM3 Framework on some UHG proprietary applications(Health Care applications) hence this knowledge cannot be adequately transferred to any other candidate within the short period of time. Moreover since this job requires integration of other tools (AE Expeienece, MORC anmd MINDI) as part of UPM developed by Anil Gogua, the knowledge cannot be transferred to any other person in a reasonable amount of time.


Why Anil Gogia only :-
======================
At least 16-20 months of hands on experience is required to be able to completely own this tool. Since this is in-house developed UHG proprietary UPM3 Framework - Automation, Configuration Validation tool, it is not in market and even the person being trained need to have at least 5-7 months of experience in each of UHG business applications domain knowledge along with technical and process knowledge of each specifuc healthcare domain. And it can be learnt only through hands on experience. In addition another 5-6 months of hands on experience is also required on other tools(AE Experience tool - for fetching business service error logs from server to diagnose the service work flow and issues in run time, AE SUIT tool - to adminsiter UPM busness services) of UPM3 Framework that need to be integrated.


This Framework needs to be customized for various health care applications of multiple business client and backend provider applications and hence need a close collaboration with the business stakeholders who are based in U.S. Since working with these stakeholders require alignment of the shift timing to U.S. time, it is not possible for Anil Gogia to perform this work while being in India. Moreover, continuous interaction is required with these stakeholders and will be more effective if had face to face as lot of minute details need to be pondered over to correctly implement this tool on the respective applications.


Position involving Specialized Knowledge :-
===========================================
Anil Gogia is looking after the technical delivery of the Application Enablement program from offshore. He provides the technical oversight to the offshore team.  Given his knowledge on varied internal systems, his support to enterprise wide programs like UPM, WMB is very critical. His technical leadership is being highly valued by various stakeholders. He was once awarded UHG’s most prestigious award ‘Sustaining Edge’ for his technical delivery excellence and leadership for AE Business Enterprise Services that he built.
October 2014, He received ‘Best Technology Manager’ for his work on UPM3 Frameowoek successful integration with Member Portal as Proof of Concepts.



Anil Gogia knowledge is helping UHG competitiveness in the market place. His knowledge of the Application Enablement UPM Framework system that make it “special” and how it is applied in the international marketplace.
========================================================================
Anil Gogia, has been working with UHG from more than 8 years by now. He has worked and gained a lot of functional knowledge on various UHG based proprietary applications like ISET, ILEAD, ODIN, EHP, MYUHC, B2C, OptumId etc. These application has a direct integration with AE application. Currently, UPM3 Framework is going through a pilot phase, where it integrates with a limited set of UHG based proprietary applications. Post pilot phase, UPM3 framework is expected to get integrated with a lot more UHG based application. Having someone with such a disparate knowledge on these platforms will definitely be a big plus.  Anil Gogia seems to be a perfect fit in this role.


Special skills - not generally found in the Industry :-
The RFE specifically requests that Anil Gogia explain why his duties require specialized knowledge and why others in the Company can’t perform them. 
======================================================================================================================================================
Duties require special knowledge because the Application Enablement's UPM3 and WMB broker(Websphere Message Broker) application which Anil Gogia is working on interacts with various UHG propriety backend  systems. A deep knowledge about these backend systems is absolute must to be able to leverage and integrate these backend systems with Application Enablemeny application. Anil Gogia, has gained this knowledge about different UHG propriety systems while working on various different projects within UHG in the past. This knowledge becomes extremely valuable while working on Application Enablement application.
