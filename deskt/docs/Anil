Q10 Provide a detailed explanation as to what type of financial impact (cost savings, time, customer retention, etc.) the applicant has made on the Company.  


Anil Gogia has been working on various modules of Application Enablement applications from last 92 months. He has acquired special domain knowledge while working on these assets, which cannot be achieved without considerable work experience involving complex business requirement, design and service verifications. He is strong Technicaly as well as SME for not only these applications but also for Consuming application and Provider area as well as US healthcare business.


Business is looking for a way to replace customized IBM to Unisys SB gateway and Enterra application with AE services and Migration of United Programming Model Framework 2 to United Programming Model Framework 3, which is already proposed and Piloted successfully, subsequently Business would be happy to save expenses on these external products. Transferring this kind of knowledge in a short span of time to an equally efficient person would be a time consuming and significantly economic inconvenience to the organization, since people with skills comparable to Anil Gogia would require much time understanding the overall architecture and design and might be difficult to find out in the US and Indian market place. Also the loss of business & its customers would be added discomfort to UHG during the upcoming Production releases of this project.
 
The kind of knowledge Anil Gogia has acquired in Application Enablement applications is not simply by reading manuals or trainings. He has gained a significant knowledge on United Programming Model and US HealthCare by working hard on the system and digging in depth when we faced issues in the past and it took 7 + years for him to reach the level where he is now. 

It would require 10-12 months for a person to be able to provide basic support for Application Enablement application, around 1.5 Year to be able to work independently on small to medium complexity issues. But it would require more than 2 years for an employee to work on advanced topics with high level of complexity
As this knowledge transfer would require significant time duration and another individual would needs to work at least 3 years on these Application Enablement  applications (UPM & WMB) to gain end to end functional knowledge of these applications, it cannot be accomplished without a considerable financial impact to the organization.


And hence he has functional and technical knowledge expertise, which cannot be easily transferred to other employees. Anil Gogia has a combination of both 'Functional Expertise'  and ‘Technical Expertise’



====================================================================================================================================================================
Q11 Are there other members on this team who have been or who will be transferred to the U.S. to work on this project?  If yes, explain in detail why multiple people are required to be onsite for this project. Describe in detail how the applicant’s specialized knowledge is different from those who have been transferred to the U.S. 

No, We don’t have any other team member who has been transferred to the U.S. to work on Application Enablement United Programming Model Project.
And also no other team member (Apart from Anil Gogia) will be transferred to the U.S. to work on this Project for assignments (Migration of United Programming Model 2 Framework to United Programming Model 3 Framework and MORC Integration Director (MINDI - UPM3 Config) app production implementation and integration to other Consumer applications).

Following training we expect him to share to onshore team members and discuss with business for their need and priorirt for implementing these in project.
. AE United Programming Business services domain knowledge
. Sharing of implementation experience of Websphere 7 and AE Experience
. Modular OSGI Runtime Container (MORC) and MORC Integration Director (MINDI) application Framework with client's requirements
. Migration of IBM to Unisys SB gateway and Enterra application with AE services and UPM 2 to UPM3 Framework Business Services


====================================================================================================================================================================

Q12 Applicant’s experience in comparison of others within the project/technology/application team – 

Comparing Anil Gogia to other people working on Application Enablement:

A team of Twenty two associates are working on Application Enablement application. Out of that four are in the lead position each one handling various roles. All these four leads and teams working under the guidance of him. Anil Gogia is the most experienced technically in the Application Enablement UPM & Infra, MORC Integration Director (MINDI) UPM3 Config applications team. Anil Gogia is working as a Senior Technical Architect due to his expertise in US Healthcare and exposure over both Technical Specialist and Business Domain Knowledge of Application Enablement Applications. Anil Gogia has got 12+ years of experience and the rest of the four associates’ average experience up to 8 years. 

====================================================================================================================================================================



====================================================================================================================================================================


Anil Gogia has worked for this application since last 7 years and 8 months. He has complete awareness about the risk/challenges involved with these applications along with the background of technical design decision. He has acquired specialized knowledge of these applications and developed multiple Application Enablement processes/standards. He also gained strong knowledge of the business segments that use Application Enablement applications by multiple proofs of concept and implementation of these segments onto Application Enablement platform. Moreover Anil Gogia has gained specialized knowledge of various Application Enablement Business Data models and programming modeling techniques which is difficult to gain without extensive hands-on experience.

Anil Gogia has also got extensive healthcare trainings and possess technical expertise on middleware tool/technologies as Business Serviuce, Business Process Managed Objects, Oracle, DB2, Mongo DB, LISA, Unix, Spring Framework, DataPower XI50/52 and SVN, PVCS. 

While working in Application Enablement Platform Anil Gogia has designed, developed many complex business services models like Total Cost Estmation services , Claims Highway Frad Detection Services, Claims, Providers, Optum Digital Intelligence Network (ODIN), PAS upgardes, Benefit Service, ICare Management, Claims Reconciliation, Alliance Service, Enterprise Single Sign on Services, Member Poral services, Consumer Account, Consumer Coverage Services, VAS, Oxford healthcare services, Optum Rx Pharmacy, Optum Rx Benefits services, Optum Digital Intelligence Network (ODIN), Business to Business (B2B), Business to Consumer (B2C), Enterprise Voice Portal (EVP) and etc.

Anil Gogia is the only UHGI offshore resource having expert knowledge on Application Enablement Applications (UPM, MORC Integration Director (MINDI), UPM Admin & AE Logger SUIT tool, WMB). In absence of Anil Gogia, we will have to hire a US Healthcare domain expert and Middleware resource and then he/she would take at least 30 months to gain similar knowledge on these Application Enablement applications as that of Anil Gogia.

Anil Gogia is working on following 2 Key applications which are very crucial for Application Enablement healthcare business –

UPM2 to UPM3 Migration is a key migration activity for Application Enablement projects.Currently we have more than 500 services in UPM2 framework, which needs to be migrated to UPM3 framework in align with Business process and guidelines.Around 60 consuming applications consumes these 500+ business services and each conusind application have furher 400- 1000 users which ueses these functionalities as part of Portal either Member Portal, Provider Portla, Employer Portal. Number of transactions hittimg AE UPM is more than 700-800 million per day. Migration of these AE UPM business services in timeframe is most important for United. Any delay in migration will result of more money, effort to United in areas of Claim, Member enrollment and eligibility, Provider, Member care management, Pre Authorization, Pharmacy, etc.

MORC Integration Director (MINDI - UPM3 Config) app is the Dynamic Configuration app used to configure AE UPM3 Business service without need to restart of Application Servers which helps in providing UPM serviuces to Consumer 24*7*365 through out year and will save United loss of Business because of no/less down time of United Consumer applications to fetch Business data from Application Enablement platforms.

Comparison :-
Anil Gogia is currently working as Senior Technical Architect in UnitedHealth Group (India). His profile is more towards architectural design, resolution of production issues and development of tools which helps in optimizing the production environment. Initially he was working with the development team in Application Enablement at offshore. Later on, new assignment i.e. support for the production environment was given to Application Enablement offshore. Any production support team requires people who are capable enough to handle the code/design specific issues and should have good understanding of production environment. Application Enablement also required a group of such people. So, the team started with Mr. Anil Gogia including into it. He possesses good technical, business knowledge, logical aptitude and expertise to assume the duties of resolution of production issues and stabilizing the environment. Because of his innovative approach he always tried to automate the process, and makes this easier for others. On the same line Anil Gogia developed tool like Modular OSGI Runtime Container (MORC), MORC Integration Director (MINDI), AeMqVisualizer, AE-logger, Error Reporting etc. which helps in triaging the production issues at brisk pace, which was later recognized as a remarkable achievement for the project. This tool is much appreciated by different stakeholders of the continued projects. He has been honored with Awards for his excellent performance in the team.

Anil Gogia has good knowledge and understanding with United Programming Model Framework 3 and Web sphere Message Broker 7. Anil Gogia is the only Team member who knows UPM, MQ WMB, Java, Main Frame technologies which distinguish him from rest of the team member.

Though working at offshore he has the knowledge of the integrated environments of this complex application to a great extent. If we talk about the UHG internal processes, various applications and other tools used in UHG, knowledge of the AE application, Anil Gogia is the only resource in this team of around 22 people at offshore, who has excellent understanding in every aspect. His role is also critical because he has worked with the functional and technical side of this application 
To compare Anil Gogia with other AE team members, I’d say that he has the maximum experience and technology, business knowledge to expedite any kind of requirement whether it’s big or small, since it requires knowledge of the entire module of this complex application and Anil Gogia is the only one who has worked in almost all the areas of this application. 

Anil Gogia has a Master's degree in computer science. Along with this, he has completed various technical and domain specific certifications/trainings. I feel that nobody in the team has this much number of feathers in his/her cap.

And, Anil Gogia, as explained above of his skillset, and the trainings received on internal systems, provided valuable contributions to the application which are high appreciated.



====================================================================================================================================================================
Q18 Does this applicant have knowledge that cannot be easily transferred to another individual without significant economic inconvenience to the Company? If yes, please explain.  



Anil Gogia is the brain behind the designs and integration frameworks laid out that are highly complex as they require integration amongst several system like MY United Health Care (MYUHC), Integrated Service Experience Tool (ISET), I Listen,Educate,Assist, Delight(ILEAD), Optum Digital Intelligence Network (ODIN), OISP, Employer E Services (EES) and other various data sources, Consumer Database (CDB) and Network Database (NDB), COSMOS, Consumer Account Management System (CAMS) , VAS, Optum Rx Pharmacy Claim (RXCLAIM) which are complex and need special analytical and technical ability for someone to understand, and integrate to form a framework which is highly extensible and scalable across various modules.

Anil Gogia has spent 7.8 successful years serving project with his innovative ideas and implementations of the same. It would take any good candidate at least 10-12 months to be able to provide support for this kind of complex application. In order to start working independently on the assigned tasks, it would take more than 1.5 year for that person; and that too on issues with small to medium complexity. But it takes more than 2 year to train an employee to an advanced knowledge level and productivity.
 
Here the case of Anil Gogia was different to a great extent. He is the only resource who knows United Programming Model (UPM), Websphere Message Broker WMB, Messaging Queue MQ and Mainframe technologies. He has worked in healthcare projects over more than 7.8 years and Lead the UPM, WMB offshore team. So his overall  experience with this industry and understanding of the similar application architecture makes him special to perform complex tasks in this project. 
Business is interested in using his abilities and technical skills within the ongoing production releases by implementing his self developed Utility tools like AELogger, Modular OSGI Runtime Container (MORC), MORC Integration Director (MINDI), AeMqVisualizer which would help in planning and smooth execution of this task for the current scenario of the application. Business is also looking for a way to replace customized IBM to Unisys gateway and replace SB Gateway and Enterra application with AE services, which is already proposed and Piloted successfully, subsequently Business would be happy to save expenses on these external products. 
Transferring this kind of knowledge in a short span of time to an equally efficient person would be a time consuming and significantly economic inconvenience to the organization, since people with skills comparable to Anil Gogia would require much time understanding the overall architecture and design and might be difficult to find out in the US and Indian market place. Also the loss of business & its customers would be added discomfort to UHG during the upcoming Production releases of this project.
 
And hence he has functional and technical knowledge expertise, which cannot be easily transferred to other employees. Anil Gogia has a combination of both 'Functional Expertise'  and ‘Technical Expertise’ as below:

•	Has proficiency to work on multiple IT technologies, ranging from Messaging based application development, big data technologies (worked on MongoDB, Hadoop) to diverse Databases (Microsoft SQL Server 2005, Microsoft Access, Oracle 10g/9i, IBM DB2)
•	Has worked on diverse data sources in UnitedHealth Group; some of the key names being Consumer Database (CDB) and Network Database (NDB).

In addition to the process knowledge of UHG proprietary applications, Anil Gogia is the a critical asset to the project.  He will be using this knowledge acquired in UHG India extensively in his upcoming assignments in UHG US. Having made key contributions to this project demonstrates that Anil Gogia has advanced knowledge that is uncommon, noteworthy, or distinguished as compared to the knowledge of others, both inside and outside of the company. As a result, it is necessary to integrate the beneficiary’s specialized knowledge into the UHG U.S operations in order to move the project forward. For this reason, it will be difficult to impart various aspects of his knowledge and experience to another individual without significant economic inconvenience.


====================================================================================================================================================================
