============================================================================================================================================
1)	Deploy your services to stage site. Verify that the configurations are copied to stage and the service works in stage once deployed. From now on, the deploy should include stage site.
2)	Add service configurations to production using config URL - http://u3c.uhc.com/mindi/. Use “pre-prod” for change ticket number for your updates. Verify that the following configurations, along with any other dependent configurations are added to production:
a.	Dataservice layer configuration(s). Also add queue configurations if not in production. 
b.	Service layer authorization and config.
c.	Consumer security group. Add the new client applicationName to both its security group and also “UPM3_AE_PRD” security group. Security group name can be found at this link: http://uniteddocs.uhc.com/itservices2/AETeam/PMO/Lists/Applications/AllItems.aspx. Contact dev lead if you cannot find the consumer security group.
3)	In your IntellJ, run Felix with -DUPM_ENVIRONMENT=prod. Use your non-prod test case from soapUI to test against your local IntellJ to make sure no prod configuration error (do not use this step for create/update/delete type services).


The day after prod release date:

Developer does the following post-prod checking:
Test your service pointing directly to production endpoint via soapui, using a non-prod test. Make sure there are no UPM3 configuration or authorization errors. We do not expect a successful response because backend prod may be not ready and our test data may not exist in prod. The goal here is to verify that the service and configurations are setup correctly in production. Do not run these tests in production for create/update/delete type services.


Defect Triage process:


1)	Defect Triage doc: http://uniteddocs.uhc.com/itservices2/AETeam/QA%20Testing/QA%20Documentation/QA%20Process%20Triage%20and%20Monitoring%20ALM%20Defects.doc
2)	All UPM2 defects should go to Kokkarakonda, Ugender .
3)	All UPM3 defects should go to Arora, Himanshu(AE) 
4)	Copy AE QA Offshore team along with Anil Gogia.
5)	If there are multiple issue mentioned in defect then we will ask detector to raise separate defect for an individual issue. In this case we do not pass to anyone here in our team.
6)	If any defect comes to AE bucket, that should have:
-	AE specific end point
-	Request XML
-	Response XML
7)	All WMB defects info along with UPM mentioned in triage doc.
8)	MQ defects should go to Onshore only.
9)	DMZ internal endpoints defects are AE defects and we handle these defects. We follow the general process for DMZ defect assignment. Ex: uhgservicegateway-tst.uhc.com will go to Himanshu
10)	All data power issues should first go to UPM and then to Venkat Rayalla . This depend on nature of defect.
11)	All WESB defects should go to Nagumalla, Sunil Chakravarthy for offshore.
12)	JMS issue: QA need to fetch WMB request/response xml and attach to defect and directly assign to WMB offshore contact. In this case you need to run the request via soap and get the logs by putting UID in Log viewer: https://aeprod.uhc.com/aeapp/start.htm. Ex of UID <uid>[[GPS||22795920]UPM3-BRAVO-FRONTEND]</uid>
13)	
Search for MQ_REQ_RESP, create a doc with these logs, attach to defect and assign to WMB contact (offshore)
14)	33443: Bravo
22443: Alpha
11443: Systest
15)	All COMET issues goes to Onshore.
16)	We do not pick any  Tricare defects, leave them in a app bucket.
17)	App Contact List : http://uniteddocs.uhc.com/itservices2/AETeam/PMO/Lists/Application%20Contacts/AllItems.aspx
